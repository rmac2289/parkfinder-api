## Summary

Find Your Park is a web app designed to allow the user to find parks 
in California. Users can browse hundreds of California parks by location
via the built in map, or activities/park name using the search feature.
If a user wishes to read comments left by other users, leave a comment themselves, or suggest a park to add, they will need to sign up for an
account via the signup page and then login to the account.
